Here is an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mary&#39;s site is hosted on Github pages. She didn&#39;t want to have a recurring hosting cost etc etc</li>
<li>John&#39;s site is on shared hosting. He appreciates that he can use standard tools like <code>rsync</code> and <code>SSH</code> to publish his site.</li>
</ul>
<p>These case studies could be introduced in early chapters, and be used as illustrative examples throughout. Their sites could actually exist, so that readers could poke at them and borrow code.</p>
