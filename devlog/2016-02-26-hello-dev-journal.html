<p>Hi new dev journal!</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>
<ul>
<li>I do lots of interesting stuff that I never tell a soul about. I&#39;d like to practice creating a narrative around my creations</li>
<li>Often, when I do write about my work, the writing act takes me away from what I was doing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="this-is-a-place-for">This is a place for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Logging whatever I&#39;m working on at the moment</li>
<li>Quick brain dumps</li>
<li>Jotting down ideas without worrying about editing</li>
</ul>
<p>More than anything, it&#39;s my intention to cultivate a practice of journaling.</p>
<h2 id="it-is-not-a-place-for">It is not a place for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Careful editing and indepth posts</li>
<li>A consistently cohesive narrative</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process-rules">Process rules</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t meta-analyze much. Just write down your thoughts and move on.</p>
<p>If you feel like this might be a fruitful topic to write about in more depth, add it to a list of post ideas. Set aside time once or twice a week for in-depth writing, and choose one topic for each session.</p>
<h2 id="some-secondary-purposes">Some secondary purposes</h2>
<p>These posts might end up being useful post-creation, but need not be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mining my own ideas for other work</li>
<li>Sharing out, to get feedback from friends and colleagues.</li>
</ul>
<p>but its primary purpose is to provide a space for cultivating a practice of journaling.</p>
<p>This is a place for me to talk about whatever I&#39;m working on at the moment. </p>
<h2 id="design-principles">Design principles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optimize for journaling</li>
<li>also looking back on recent history</li>
<li>and searching</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid">Avoid</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fancy headers/templates. Keep the templates as simple as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m often reluctant to post process stuff directly to social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook, but feel much more comfortable posting the primary source on ato a site I control, and then sharing links to different outlets.</p>
