  Mash up "space/bag" concept from TiddlyWeb with Github group model, using Firebase, to support private and collaborative content spaces
layout: default
---

This is actually the "bag" concept from TiddlyWeb, but "space" sounds better.

/user/space
/group/space

You can:

 - sign in
 - create a space
 - CRUD items in a space, with validation
 - view owned spaces

Then:

 - share a space with another user
 - view shared spaces

Bags have an owner
You can only see your own bags

## Worries

Maybe we need the concept of a recipe still? Would it be possible to support that in firebase (no, but possible to simulate using the client)
