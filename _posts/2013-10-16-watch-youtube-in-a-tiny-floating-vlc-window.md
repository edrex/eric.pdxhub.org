<p class="col-xs-6">I like to watch conference talks and engineering lectures while I'm working, in a small unobtrusive window. This is great on a retina display. Here's how.</p>

### Youtube in VLC

 1. VLC can open Youtube URLs (drag from URL bar to App icon or paste into open dialog)
 2. By default VLC uses the highest quality stream available, which is bad for cafes etc. You can adjust the quality in Prefs > Show All > "Input / Codecs"

### Floating VLC video

To have a floating video window:

 * Prefs > Show Basic > Interface > Uncheck "Show video within the main window"
 * Video > Uncheck "Window decorations"

Voila!
