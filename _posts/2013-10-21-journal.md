## Notation
@Tangent

This is something that has occurred to me before. The idea is to invent some human-centric notation for embedding specific metadata within typed or written documents.

An example might look like:

```
todos:
  @Home Create a list of lists to create
  #Done Write blog post about writing a blog post
```

1. extend Todo.txt syntax with a type field, different semantics per type
2. then index and extract
