    h4 Reminders

    :markdown
      - Avoid a backlog of unstarted things. Instead try to keep each thing fresh and explore it right away.
      - Keep it simple, avoiding process overhead and complexity. Get to the thing as directly as possible.
      - Try two or three things at once, for example a hosted database, a data binding framework, and an idea for a cat pictures service. This is to help avoid blank page syndrome and make demos that have some substance.

    h4 Hosting Options

    :markdown
      - **Inline:** This is appropriate for quick experiments which don't require any external tooling
      - **Plunkr:** [[1](http://plnkr.co/)] An alternative to inline posts, which can be embedded (when to use?)
      - **Seperate repo:** if the experiment needs extra tooling (different build tool, etc) or if it seems independently useful.

    h4 Circle of things

    :markdown
      To focus my work and ensure that I balance skill development, I will identify critical learning areas and rotate between them.

       - Design (color, making a site via comp)
       - Tooling (Grunt, DocPad)
       - Interactive (Facets, Viz)
       - Writing
       - Multimedia (video, photo, audio)
