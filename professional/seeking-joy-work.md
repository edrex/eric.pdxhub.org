# I'm Eric and I Like to Make Things. Hire Me!


## Things I love

Prototyping applications

Functional programming, all the flavors (but especially ML dialects like Haskell and Elm)

Human Computer Interaction. We do this so badly now, the low-hanging fruit is plentiful.

Teaching STEM

Feeding my soul/body:

 - Having exercise matts/equipment in the workplace, for body breaks
