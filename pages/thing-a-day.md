### What's this?

I want to practice something creative every day. 

This page could be viewed as a process tool to help make that happen.

### How is this thing going to help you get things done?

Avoid a backlog of unstarted things. Instead try to keep each thing fresh and explore it right away.

Avoid too many rules other than that each thing should be tagged "thing-a-day".
