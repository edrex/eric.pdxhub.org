Provenance and Verifiability in the Decentralized Social Internet

Decentralized Public Discourse requires Provenance and

Magic hash trees! How a simple data structure can decentralize the social Internet

## Intended skill level

What skill level does your audience need to be at to get something out of your talk?

We'll build up from scratch, but we'll be moving fast so beginners may want to click on the Wikipedia links ahead of time.

## Timeline for your talk

How will you use your 10 minutes? : ]

Talking over pictures!

0:01 Define social discourse
1:01 List examples such as blog posts, news articles, academic papers
2:01 Argue for the importance of provenance in remote discourse using examples from biology and antiquity
3:01 The problem of provenance: how to establish that your Twitter account, your blog, and your Github are all the same person (reciprocal linking, prominent shout out to IndieAuth).
4:01 Hashes are the URLs of decentralized networks
5:01 Methods for establishing provenance: public claims and crypto signatures
6:01 The problem of referential integrity: we trust facebook not to allow the post we just "liked" to change to something we don't like.
7:01 How content addressable storage provides strong referential integrity.
8:01 Bringing it all together
8:31 Pillowfork: decentralized storytelling, with forks.
9:31 Contact info etc
 
## Abstract for your talk


The social Internet can be decentralized by solving the the problems of provenance and referential integrity using content addressable storage.

Sneakily, it is also about

 - the provenance of public speech, and how to publish

Hash trees (a.k.a. Merkle trees) are a wonderfully-useful data structure from classical computer science.

This talk is about applications of Merkle trees in the domain of public speech - discourse.

Specifically, we will show how a simple encapsulation strategy for public posts and links enables verifiability of the provenance of each post, and of any posts referenced.


Said another way; if

We will present a set of tools 

can be used to design message formats for speech with strong guarantees about provenance.




the many connections between classical computer science data structures and narrative.
