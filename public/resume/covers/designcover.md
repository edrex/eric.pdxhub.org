Hi 52 Limited, 

I'm a broadly-skilled senior software developer, looking for opportunities to do more user-facing frontend work. Based on recommendations from a few friends, 52 Limited's focus seems to fit nicely with my skill set and direction.

I've attached a resume focused on my frontend work. I also have plenty of experience building services and data stores. I've left out lists of particular technologies fluencies since they would be lengthy; let me know if you'd like that level of detail in any particular areas.

Hope to hear from you soon!

Best,  
Eric Drechsel


Hi Crowd Compass, 

I'm an experienced, skilled full stack software developer, looking for opportunities to work more on the UI/UX area of the spectrum, as well as to mentor in areas where I am strong and to learn in areas where I would like to grow. Crowd Compass seems like an engaged and passionate team with an exciting product, and I would love to join.

Hope to hear from you!

Best,  
Eric Drechsel
