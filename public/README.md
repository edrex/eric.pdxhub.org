## Credits

**Posts** are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (no Jekyll-style YAML header), unless they contain lots of markup in which case they are written in [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) (using the `:markdown` Jade filter for prose sections).

**Layouts** and other XML/HTML templates are written in Jade.

**Styles** are currently written in [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/guide), although I plan to switch to LESS since it has a simpler, more expressive syntax and a more portable implementation.

Posts are **processed** by [Harp](http://harpjs.com/community)
