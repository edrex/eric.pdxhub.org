Thinking about:

## Build my site service

- Whenever I push to Github, my website is updated
- Website is stored in S3
- Should support multiple sites

## Sub-document granularity

- a day journal is essentially just a bunch of independent snippets
- it could be generated from a date index if all the snippets were independently stored
- then I could index them other ways as well
- including sorting the private stuff from the public
  - maybe some sort of input language would be useful
  - it would be processed into a bunch of snippets
  - what would it look like?
  - how would it handle updates to snippets? would it need to?

- what about a UI for working with snippets "in context"
- Workspaces
  - Journal
    - Show all items created today.
    - Items created here are not tagged with anything special.
  - Some tag
    - Show items with this tag
    - Items created here get the tag
  - Some combination of tags
    - same
  - Could work for other contexts too
  - Project
    - Show action context
    - 


* i am thinking about camlistore


- this stream of consciousness writing feels good
  - i have felt stuck lately, hung up on my broken process

## TOYS!!

- how am I feeling today form
- t:Wisdom #mantra IGNORE EVERYTHING

- I need a systematic way of thinking
- a way to reconcile the stream of time with the world of abstract objects
  - objects are timeless
  - CAS approaches timelessness
  - by representing things in a way that makes them eternal.
  - they existed before, you just didn't hold the BLOBREF
- stream
- lexer
- character ranges (UTF8) (objects in the stream)
- creational grammars
- picking objects out of the stream
- stream as data type


What did I get out of brainstorming today?
