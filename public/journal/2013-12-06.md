## Commitment to hybrid build

I am using Harp to build my pages. However, it is sub-optimal when it comes to CSS and JS builds.

 - For CSS, I think I need to be using Ruby Sass instead of libsass, which Harp doesn't do.
 - For JS, Brunch or Grunt I think. They are purpose-built for that.

Maybe something like this makes sense:

 - Sass -> public/styles
 - Brunch -> public/scripts

Unfortunately, Harp doesn't support --watch for compile mode. This needs to be fixed I think.
