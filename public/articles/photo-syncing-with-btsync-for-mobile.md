Today I decided to setup BitTorrent Sync on my Android phone to sync my camera photos. I'm so happy I did!

BTSync is software based on the BitTorrent protocol which keeps folders syncronized between multiple devices. It supports iOS/Android as well as PC/Mac/Linux, and works well with large files such as full-resolution images and videos.

By sharing the DCIM folder from my Android phone with my laptop, I can ensure that the photos I take on my phone are always backed up, without relying on a cloud sync solution such as those promoted by Google, Microsoft, and Apple. There are plenty of reasons to avoid putting your data on the corporate cloud, including:

 - Erosion of privacy and content rights
 - Difficulty getting full-resolution data out.
 - Storage space limits.
 - Reliance on systems which you don't control. *Surprise, you've been screwed by a corporation!*

BTSync doesn't have any of these problems, and is phenomenally robust (much moreso than any cloud solution).

Other use-cases for which BTSync is ideally suited:

 - Sending fresh tunes and movies to your phone from your laptop.
 - Sharing between a group of people, such as a team working on a website.
 - Maintaining a pool of media files between friends.

*I'd recommend giving BTSync a try. It's going to be around for awhile.*
