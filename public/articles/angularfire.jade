    p The app in this dive talks to a Firebase instance and renders using Angular.js.
    p I've built things with Angular before but this is my first dive into Firebase. Some of the characteristics which make it interesting are:
    dl
      dt NoBackend
      dd It does both kinds of auth (Z and N!) so you can dispense with backend code entirely and write your app on the client. The only exception is a simple, flexible language for specifying authorization rules.
      dt Realtime sync
      dd Data is synced automatically to connected clients when changes occur, enabling realtime updates in collaborative apps.
      dt Structured data
      dd Data in Firebase is basically a tree of JSON.
    p
      | There are several other backends which have similar characteristics, including the open source 
      a(href='http://www.deployd.com/') deployd
      | , which I'll be exploring in a future dive.

        p I wanted to first get the stack working, so I did the basic Firebase tutorial app as a page in a Jekyll site.

          | I ran into one silly issue with Jekyll's Liquid processing eating my mustaches before they got to Angular, which was solved by wrapping the whole page in a
