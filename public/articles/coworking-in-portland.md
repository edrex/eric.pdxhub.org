## [Collective Agency](http://collectiveagency.co/membership/)

More open floorplan, side rooms with whiteboards and phones. Collectivist. Some people have reported eerie quiet in the main area during the day weirds them out but you should try it and see for yourself.

They have an open house once monthly as well, which is be posted here: http://calagator.org/venues/202392813

## [Hatch](http://www.hatchthefuture.org/join-our-community/individuals/)

These guys have a mix of open floor and "fireboxes" which are little cubes (what a bad name right?). They have a less techie, more traditional service professional vibe. They have a "5 day a month" membership level with access to conf rooms etc. Also in a cool neighborhood, which is nice for thinking/walks.

## [Nedspace](http://nedspace.com/)

A Portland institution and that has helped filled the void (along with CoAg) left when [Cube Space closed](http://gigaom.com/2009/06/09/cubespace-to-close/) in 2009.
