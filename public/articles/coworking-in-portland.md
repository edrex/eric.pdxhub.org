The three strongest options that I have direct experience with:

More open floorplan, side rooms with whiteboards and phones. Collectivist. Some people have reported eerie quiet in the main area during the day weirds them out but you should try it and see for yourself.

They have an open house once monthly as well, which is be posted here: http://calagator.org/venues/202392813
